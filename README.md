# Mark's Movies & TV

### What it is

**Mark's Movies & TV** is a pet project I created while pursuing a role at Microsoft France. I worked on the [Movies & TV](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/movies-tv/9wzdncrfj3p2) app at Microsoft for about a year, adding features, polishing th UI, and resolving bugs. When development for it got transferred to Paris, it felt like a serendipitous opportunity I couldn't pass up! So I decided to create this project to demonstrate my experience working on Movies & TV, and to highlight my XAML skills.

### What it does

Since I created this app primarily to showcase my experience with XAML, it's pretty bare bones as far as functionality is concerned. Instead, I focused on getting the UI as close to the original as possible. I built it from scratch, using XAML and C#, and even hand-cropped the boxart from screenshots of the original app. I also created some custom UserControls that are used on multiple pages so that the markup would stay clean. I also used a separate ResourceDictionary file [Styles.xaml](https://github.com/Axeavius/marks-movies-and-tv/blob/master/MarksMoviesAndTV/MarksMoviesAndTV/Styles/Styles.xaml) so that all of the styling is separate from the markup. 

It includes the following pages:

* Explore Page
    * Explore Trailers L2 Page
    * Explore 360 Videos L2 Page
    * Explore Movies L2 Page
    * Explore TV L2 Page
* Purchased Page
* Personal Videos Page
* Settings Page
